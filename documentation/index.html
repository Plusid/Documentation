            <p>Please read through the documentation to setup the theme before installation. For heavy customization or to change color or other CSS, see "<strong>Development</strong>" section below in this documentation.</p>

                There is a Github button in the top navigation bar of this theme. To add your github link to this button please follow the steps below.
                <ul>
                    <li>Open <code>header-nav.hbs</code> file which is located in partials folder.</li>
                    <li>At line number 4 in that file you will see this <code>&lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;&lt;a href="#" class="nav-btn"&gt;{{&gt; icons/github}}{{t "Github"}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</code></code></li>

            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>If you do not want to use any membership feature then you can just disable that in your ghost dashboard and the theme will not display any membership specific part.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>If you do not want to use the paid membership feature but still you want to allow your users to subscribe for free to collect their mail address then you have to do one small thing.</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Remove member specif links from the header menu.</strong></li>
                </ul>

			<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
			<p>If you did all the steps which are mentioned above, then you are ready to install the theme.</p>
            <p></p>Ones the necessary configuration is done, make a zip of the modified theme folder.</p>
            <p>Now login to your admin area and go to Design. In that page scroll down and you can find "Upload a theme" button. Upload the theme zip which you have created while ago. After finishing upload, activate the theme.</p>
            <p>You also have to upload another file <strong>routes.yaml</strong> in your ghost site to work all the membership related page correctly.</p>
            <p>Go to lab page in your dashboard, scroll down and you will see an option for routes. There is a button to upload routes YAML and a link below that button to download the routes.yaml which is being used currently. Download that file and and keep as a backup.</p>
            <p>IN the downloaded zip you will find a routes.yaml file which comes with this file and specific for this theme.</p>
            <p>Upload that file. Using "<strong>upload routes YAML</strong>" button.</p>
            <img src="assets/images/routes-yaml.jpg" alt="routs yaml upload">
            <p>Please note, if you are using self hosted Ghost then may be you need to restart ghost to take effect the new routes file. If you are using Ghost (pro). then you don't need to do anything here.</p>
            <p>If you want to install the demo data to make your site as the preview then you can go to <strong>your-site-url/ghost/settings/labs/</strong> and then import the <strong>digidoc.ghost.demo.json</strong> file there. This file is located in <strong>demo data</strong> folder in main download folder.</p>
            
            <h3 id="writing_posts_or_articles">Writing posts / articles</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>This theme groups posts based on tags, and show them in ascending order by published time/date. Which means firstly added post or tag (category on home page, and sidebar links in single post view ) will be shown on top and last post or tag will be shown last.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>This ordering and grouping is made for documentation writing workflow and user reading experience. </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                In blogs, user wants to read the latest post( lastly added post) first when they visit any blog site. 
            </p>
            <p>
                But in case of Documentation, user want to go through beginning to end. Also who write this documentation (in this case you) prefer to write beginning to end.
            </p>
            <p>
                So to match both case and build better user experience we made the order ascending. But this not means that you can not add any new article in a category later.
            </p>
            <p>
                At first before writing and publishing any post / article, create the category in order ( top to bottom or start to end ) in which you want to show guide through your user.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>To do that just create a tag for each post group (category and tag are same thing here) by visiting your admin dashboard tag page.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>After that write posts and add a tag to that post to show that post in that tag group.</strong>
            </p>

            <h3 id="adding_images_to_tags">Adding images to tags / categories</h3>
            <p>
                In home page each category (post group) shows an image. Those are tag images.
            </p>
            <p>
                Add an image to each tag and those will be shown there. Preferred image size ratio is 1:1 which means square image. In demo we used icons from flaticon (<a href="https://www.flaticon.com/">https://www.flaticon.com/</a> ).
            </p>


            <h3 id="navigation">Navigation links</h3>
            <p>
                Ghost support two set of navigation. In this theme the primary navigation will be shown at the top of the page and secondary navigation will be shown in the footer.
            </p>
			<p>To add links to you static page please follow the steps below.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Create a new page in your dashboard.</li>
				<li>Copy the url for this page from the page settings panel.</li>
				<li>Go to Design page in your admin dashboard.</li>

            <p>
                Ghost introduced Theme translation and blog localization feature in version 1.20.0. We implemented translation support to this theme. Please follow the steps below to translate this theme in your language. Please follow the steps below to correctly translate the theme in your language.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Within theme folder, there is a folder named "locales". In that folder by default you will find a file named "en.json". This is the default file for english language and you have to use this file to create your own language file.</li>
                <li>make a copy of en.json and give a name following this format <code>[language_code].json</code> ( example: for french <strong>fr.json</strong> for German i.e. Deutsch "<strong>de.json</strong> for Russian <strong>ru.json</strong> etc. )</li>
                <li>If you are not sure about what is you language code then you can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">visit this wiki page</a> and see. Use the two letter (ISO 639-1) code.</li>
                <li>Now open the newly created &lt;your_language&gt;.json file in text editor. You will see "KEY": "VALUE" format in each line.</li>
                <li>In english language KEY and VALUE are same. Now you read the left part of the <code>:</code> which is KEY part, and change the right part which is VALUE part to your own language.</li>
                <li>After finishing the translation Save the file and upload the theme to your site.</li>
                <li>Go to your admin area, Visit "Genera" setting page and change the "publication Language" option. By default there is "en" for english. Add your own language code there in place of "en" and save the settings.</li>
                <li>Visit your site, If everything goes right, you will see all the theme related text in your site is in your translated language.</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>If you translate the theme in any language, then please consider to share ( feel free to send me via <a href="mailto:gbjsolution@gmail.com">email</a> ) that language file. I will add that file to the theme, so that it will available to other users.</strong>
            <h2>Development</h2>
            <h3 id="theme_customization">Theme Customization</h3>
            <p>If you need to add only small css then you can add using Ghost's <a href="https://help.ghost.org/article/24-code-injection">Code Injection</a> feature. In "blog header" box you can add css like below examle. replace the css with your own css between the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    &lt;style&gt;
                        .header-wrapper .text-logo {
                            color: #076eff;
                        }
                    &lt;/style&gt;
                </code>
            </pre>
            <h3>Detail customization prerequisite</h3>
            <p>This theme is built using Gulp to compile javascript and CSS. CSS is written in SCSS. So if you want to modify the theme color, styles or appearance or anything you want to customize, before doing that you need to setup development environment setup.</p>
            <p>Please follow all the steps below one by one to do it.</p>
            <p>You need to have installed <strong>node js</strong> and <strong>gulp</strong> installed in your local machine.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you don't have nodejs installed in your machine then visit <a href="https://nodejs.org/">nodejs.org</a> and download and install latest LTS version of node js.</li>
                <li>After installing node js open a command prompt or terminal. Then type <code>node -v</code>. If it shows a version number then node js is installed correctly. Also enter this command <code>npm -v</code> to see npm ( comes with node js) is installed properly.</li>
                <li>After installing node js you need to install Gulp CLI globally in your machine. So in your terminal or command prompt enter this command. <code>npm install gulp-cli -g</code>. It may take some time, it will install Gulp CLI globally in your machine. Now you have done the environment setup.</li>
                <li>At this point go to the development theme folder. In downloaded zip there is a folder named "development". Within that folder you will see a folder named as the theme name. Enter in that folder and run command prompt / terminal here. Or you can navigate to this folder within already running terminal.</li>
                <li>Now enter command <code>npm install</code>. It may take some time. It will install all the development dependency within the project. It may show some warning, don't worry those are OK.</li>
                <li>At this time you are ready to modify theme, Run one more command <code>gulp</code> in the terminal. It will initially compile all files and star to watch file changes. Keep the terminal open and start customizing the theme.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="change_color">How to Change Color or CSS</h3>
            <p>In the theme folder you will find "assets > scss" folder which contains all the theme styles written in SCSS.</p>
            <p>To change any style / css you need to modify here. In SCSS folder you will find a folder named "components" which contains a bunch of .scss files which are part of the whole theme's style. and all those files are imported in a specific order in "screen.scss" file located in "scss" folder root outside of "components" folder. please dont edit that file.</p>
			<p><strong>To change the Theme color please follow the steps below.</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Open the <code>_color-and-font.scss</code> file in your code editor.</li>
				<li>Now you have to change the color hexcode (#xxxxxx) in this file and save the file.</li>
				<li>If you have followed the above section of instruction ( <strong>Detail customization prerequisite</strong>), and already running terminal with the gulp command then the file changes will be detected and if there is no error in your file then it will be automatically compiled.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The <code>_color-and-font.scss</code> file looks like below.</p>
			<pre>
                <code>
/*=====================================================
    Font

$font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
/*=====================================================

    success: #0ca910,
    error: #f0134d,
);

$black: #000;

/*** PLEASE DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE ***/
:root { 
    @each $name, $value in $theme {
        --#{$name}: #{$value};
    }
}
                </code>
            </pre>
            
            <p>After modifying the theme css when you are done and want to install the final theme in your live site, do the following.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Go to running terminal ( terminal is navigated to development theme folder and  running <code>gulp</code> command to watch the file changes )</li>
                <li>Press <strong>Ctrl + C</strong> or <strong>Cmd + C</strong> in your keyboard to end the running task.</li>
                <li>After ending running task enter this command, <code>gulp build</code>. This command will build the production ready ( live site ready ) theme package within a folder named "build".</li>
                <li>After doing the <code>gulp build</code> if you need you can configure the theme options ( such as disqus shortname, social links etc ) then use this command <code>gulp zip</code>. It will make a folder named "dist" and make a zip of the contents of "build" folder within "dist" folder.</li>
                <li>Now you can upload this newly created zip in your ghost admin panel.</li>
            </ul>
